## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2024-10-01

This is the first stable release of Ultralytics! After 6+ years of development and testing, we're confident the API is stable and ready for production use.

### Added
- New `reset()` method for clearing client state on logout
- Support for custom `sessionId` in init options
- Support for custom `sessionTimeout` in init options
- `respectDoNotTrack` option (default: true) to honor browser DNT setting
- `ClientStats` and `DebugInfo` types exported for TypeScript users
- Production deployment guide with comprehensive documentation
- Scaling guide for high-volume deployments
- End-to-end test suite with Playwright
- Next.js example application
- Kubernetes health check probes (`/healthz` and `/readyz`)
- Database partitioning migration for large-scale deployments
- Performance benchmarks and testing suite

### Fixed
- Edge case in batch processing for large batches (>1000 events)
- Various dependency security updates

### Changed
- Finalized TypeScript type exports for 1.0 release
- Node.js 18 LTS is now the minimum supported version
- API is now considered stable - breaking changes will follow semver

### Deprecated
- `trackEvent()` method deprecated in favor of `track()` - will be removed in v2.0.0

### Migration Guide

Upgrading from v0.9.0 to v1.0.0:

1. Update your package: `npm install ultralytics@1.0.0`
2. Review deprecated methods - `trackEvent()` should be replaced with `track()`
3. (Optional) Run the new database migration for partitioning: `npm run migrate`
4. (Optional) Update Kubernetes deployments to use new health check endpoints

No breaking changes from v0.9.0.
